/* The Litos vocabulary gate.
 *
 * The 2026-07-27 terminology audit found 68 places where the product spoke in
 * the codebase's own nouns instead of the reader's. Fixing them once was not
 * enough: four separate sessions shipped features WHILE that pass was running,
 * and every one of them arrived carrying a retired word ("filler verb",
 * "throughput", "form fields", "01 DOCUMENTS"). Each was caught by hand.
 *
 * This is the gate that catches the next one. It reads only what a user can
 * actually see (JSX text and prose-shaped string literals, never comments,
 * never identifiers, never CSS classes) and fails on the retired vocabulary.
 *
 * The bar, set by Mehek: a ten-year-old with intermediate English who
 * understands the job market. Job-market words are IN (resume, recruiter,
 * posting, GPA, work authorization, sponsorship, bullet, fields). Engineering
 * nouns, compliance acronyms, vendor names, and terms we invented for
 * ourselves are OUT.
 *
 * To allow a specific line, put `vocab-allow` in a comment on it. Prefer
 * rewording. An allow is a decision to make a reader work harder.
